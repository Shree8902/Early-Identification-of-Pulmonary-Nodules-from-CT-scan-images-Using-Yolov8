# Early-Identification-of-Pulmonary-Nodules-from-CT-scan-images-Using-Yolov8
## Abstract
Due to the arbitrary nature of the shape, size, and texture of lung nodules, localizing them in CT
scan images is the task that is the most challenging. This is a problem that must be solved while
trying to come up with new ways to enhance detecting systems. Convolutional neural network which
happens to be a highly used algorithm in computer vision was employed in the deep learning
technique to demonstrate promising results, particularly for image recognition. We use CNN
building blocks based on the YOLOv8 (You only look once) to learn the various representation of
features for lung nodules detection labels, in this research, we will introduce an approach for
localizing and early identification of lung cancer nodules. Chest X-rays and CT scans are presentday screening methods being used. Previously, Computer aided diagnostic (CAD) systems based on
Convolutional Neural Networks have been used. One stage detector YOLOv8 has now been trained
on almost 4000 annotated CT scan images based on a self-created dataset in Roboflow based on
segmented pulmonary nodules. The purpose of this study was to locate the nodules that were
growing in the participants' lungs. Finding information on pulmonary nodules in medical literature
was challenging
